## Get started in two steps

Spin up the OpenAI SDK against the LLM7.io endpoint and make your first requests.

### Step 1: Set up

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Install the SDK">

```bash
pip install openai
````

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="key" title="Configure the client" defaultOpen>
    LLM7.io requires a token. Get one for free at [token.llm7.io](https://token.llm7.io/) for higher rate limits.

```python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.llm7.io/v1",
    api_key="unused",  # Required. Get it for free at https://token.llm7.io/ for higher rate limits.
)
```


  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Text generation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="square-code" title="Chat completions (Python)" defaultOpen>

```python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.llm7.io/v1",
    api_key="unused",  # Required. Get it for free at https://token.llm7.io/ for higher rate limits.
)

resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="default",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a short story about a brave squirrel."}
    ],
)

print(resp.choices[0].message.content)
```

The output will be a short story generated by the model, for example:

```
Once upon a time, in a lush green forest, there lived a brave squirrel named Sammy. Sammy was known for his adventurous spirit and his willingness to help others. One day, a fierce storm hit the forest, causing a massive tree to fall and block the entrance to the squirrel village. Without hesitation, Sammy gathered his friends and devised a plan to clear the path. With teamwork and determination, they managed to move the fallen tree and restore access to their home. The villagers celebrated Sammy's bravery, and he became a legend in the forest for his courageous act.
