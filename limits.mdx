LLM7.io supports anonymous requests plus higher tiers with tokens. Limits vary by plan and endpoint.

## Text generation (/v1/chat/completions)

| Plan | 1 second | 1 minute | 1 hour |
| ---- | -------- | -------- | ------ |
| Anonymous (no token) | 1 | 10 | 100 |
| Free token | 2 | 30 | 200 |
| Vibe ($5/mo) | 10 | 600 | 5,000 |
| Pro ($12/mo) | 25 | 1,500 | 15,000 |

Note: Maximum input sizes also depend on your tier and the specific model.

## Image generation (/v1/images/generations)

| Plan | 1 second | 1 minute |
| ---- | -------- | -------- |
| Anonymous (no token) | 1 | 5 |
| Free token | 2 | 10 |
| Vibe ($5/mo) | 10 | 60 |
| Pro ($12/mo) | 20 | 120 |

<Note>
Use a token from [token.llm7.io](https://token.llm7.io) to move from anonymous limits to token-based tiers. For higher caps, upgrade to Vibe or Pro.
